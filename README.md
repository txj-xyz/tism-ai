# `tism-ai`

A Deno2 Chat Bot wrapper around `ollama`. Discord chat bot included!

Thankfully we have **TECHNOLOGY** to solve problems for us so I've built a little meme bot for our friends to use in our chat room while hanging out.

# Running

To run the Discord bot, compile the Deno2 code to bytecode.

```bash
> deno compile --allow-net --allow-read ./chat.ts
```
